basics to reading and plotting polarization from ALMA

This is not meant to be anything fancy, but simply as a start with basic equations to make some plots. Feel free to use any part of the code for your own projects. 

Start with the "plot_image.py" example to see how the script handles IQUV image data

Then work on "plot_cut.py" to see how to make a cut in the image.
